# Nexudus_Project
Three tests where written for this project 
1. log-in page shows a clear error message when invalid details are provided
2. Log-in page logs user in when valid details are provided
3. Can add and delete a product from the products list.


You will need to do an npm install, npm update before you can run the tests. npm update is essentail because mine was running behind and I had to update mine. There might be some errors if you are using an older version but you might just be lucky. 

To run the test just do the usual npm test or npm run test.

I have a test report called cucumber-report.html which needs to be opened in browser to see the test html report.

I have also a folder called test result which houses the test recording. You on every run.

If you have any further question on the project please give me a shout but it should be smooth sailing from there. 

Happy coding :)
